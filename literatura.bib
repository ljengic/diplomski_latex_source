abstract={Under the alternating electrical excitation, biological tissues produce a complex electrical impedance which depends on tissue composition, structures, health status, and applied signal frequency, and hence the bioelectrical impedance methods can be utilized for noninvasive tissue characterization. As the impedance responses of these tissue parameters vary with frequencies of the applied signal, the impedance analysis conducted over a wide frequency band provides more information about the tissue interiors which help us to better understand the biological tissues anatomy, physiology, and pathology. Over past few decades, a number of impedance based noninvasive tissue characterization techniques such as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), electrical impedance plethysmography (IPG), impedance cardiography (ICG), and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) have been proposed and a lot of research works have been conducted on these methods for noninvasive tissue characterization and disease diagnosis. In this paper BIA, EIS, IPG, ICG, and EIT techniques and their applications in different fields have been reviewed and technical perspective of these impedance methods has been presented. The working principles, applications, merits, and demerits of these methods has been discussed in detail along with their other technical issues followed by present status and future trends.},

title = {Improved Cole parameter extraction based on the least absolute deviation method},
journal = {Physiological Measurement},
abstract = {The Cole function is widely used in bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) applications. Fitting the measured BIS data onto the model and then extracting the Cole parameters (R0, R∞, α and τ) is a common practice. Accurate extraction of the Cole parameters from the measured BIS data has great significance for evaluating the physiological or pathological status of biological tissue. The traditional least-squares (LS)-based curve fitting method for Cole parameter extraction is often sensitive to noise or outliers and becomes non-robust. This paper proposes an improved Cole parameter extraction based on the least absolute deviation (LAD) method. Comprehensive simulation experiments are carried out and the performances of the LAD method are compared with those of the LS method under the conditions of outliers, random noises and both disturbances. The proposed LAD method exhibits much better robustness under all circumstances, which demonstrates that the LAD method is deserving as an improved alternative to the LS method for Cole parameter extraction for its robustness to outliers and noises.}

abstract = {Fluid overload is a chronic medical condition that affects over six million Americans with conditions such as congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and lymphedema. Remote management of fluid overload continues to be a leading clinical challenge. Bioimpedance is one technique that can be used to estimate the hydration of tissue and track it over time. However, commercially available bioimpedance measurement systems are bulky, expensive, and rely on Ag/AgCl electrodes that dry out and can irritate the skin. The use of bioimpedance today is therefore limited to clinical and research settings, with measurements performed at daily intervals or over short periods of time rather than continuously and long-term. This paper proposes using wearable calf bioimpedance measurements integrated into a compression sock for long-term fluid overload management. A PCB was developed using standard measurement techniques that measures the calf bioimpedance using a custom analog front-end built around an AD8302 gain-phase detection chip. Data is transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy to an iOS device using a custom iOS app. Bioimpedance data were collected both from the wearable system and a commercial measurement system (ImpediMed SFB7) using RRC networks, Ag/AgCl electrodes, and the textile compression sock. Bioimpedance data collected from the wearable system showed close agreement with data from the SFB7 when using RRC networks and in five healthy human subjects with Ag/AgCl electrodes. However, when using the textile compression sock the wearable system had worse precision than the SFB7 (4% run to run compared to <mml:math id="m1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mo><</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>%</mml:mi></mml:math> run to run) and there were larger differences between the two systems than when using the RRC networks and the Ag/AgCl electrodes. Wearable system precision and agreement with the SFB7 was improved by pressure or light wetting of the current electrodes on the sock. Future research should focus on reliable elimination of low-frequency artifacts in research grade hardware to enable long-term calf bioimpedance measurements for fluid overload management.}

abstract={Bioelectrical impedance analysis and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIA/BIS) of tissues reveal important information on molecular composition and physical structure that is useful in diagnostics and prognostics. The heterogeneity in structural elements of cells, tissues, organs, and the whole human body, the variability in molecular composition arising from the dynamics of biochemical reactions, and the contributions of inherently electroresponsive components, such as ions, proteins, and polarized membranes, have rendered bioimpedance challenging to interpret but also a powerful evaluation and monitoring technique in biomedicine. BIA/BIS has thus become the basis for a wide range of diagnostic and monitoring systems such as plethysmography and tomography. The use of BIA/BIS arises from (i) being a noninvasive and safe measurement modality, (ii) its ease of miniaturization, and (iii) multiple technological formats for its biomedical implementation. Considering the dependency of the absolute and relative values of impedance on frequency, and the uniqueness of the origins of the $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, $\delta$-, and $\gamma$-dispersions, this targeted review discusses biological events and underlying principles that are employed to analyze the impedance data based on the frequency range. The emergence of BIA/BIS in wearable devices and its relevance to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) are introduced and discussed.},

abstract={The passive electrical properties of a biological tissue, referred to as the tissue bioimpedance, are related to the underlying tissue physiology. These measurements are often well-represented by a fractional-order equivalent circuit model, referred to as the Cole-impedance model. Objective: Identify if there are differences in the fractional-order ($\alpha$) of the Cole-impedance parameters that represent the segmental right-body, right-arm, and right-leg of adult participants. Hypothesis: Cole-impedance model parameters often associated with tissue geometry and fluid (R∞, R1, C) will be different between body segments, but parameters often associated with tissue type ($\alpha$) will not show any statistical differences. Approach: A secondary analysis was applied to a dataset collected for an agreement study between bioimpedance spectroscopy devices and dual-energy X-ray absoptiometry, identifying the Cole-model parameters of the right-side body segments of N=174 participants using a particle swarm optimization approach. Statistical testing was applied to the different groups of Cole-model parameters to evaluate group differences and correlations of parameters with tissue features. Results: All Cole-impedance model parameters showed statistically significant differences between body segments. Significance: The physiological or geometric features of biological tissues that are linked with the fractional-order ($\alpha$) of data represented by the Cole-impedance model requires further study to elucidate.},

  abstract = "Congestive heart failure (HF) is a complex disease state
              characterized by impaired ventricular function and insufficient
              peripheral blood supply. The resultant reduced blood flow
              characterizing HF promotes activation of neurohormonal systems
              which leads to fluid retention, often exhibited as pulmonary
              congestion, peripheral edema, dyspnea, and fatigue. Despite
              intensive research, the exact mechanisms underlying edema
              formation in HF are poorly characterized. However, the unique
              relationship between the heart and the kidneys plays a central
              role in this phenomenon. Specifically, the interplay between the
              heart and the kidneys in HF involves multiple interdependent
              mechanisms, including hemodynamic alterations resulting in
              insufficient peripheral and renal perfusion which can lead to
              renal tubule hypoxia. Furthermore, HF is characterized by
              activation of neurohormonal factors including
              renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sympathetic nervous
              system (SNS), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and anti-diuretic hormone
              (ADH) due to reduced cardiac output (CO) and renal perfusion.
              Persistent activation of these systems results in deleterious
              effects on both the kidneys and the heart, including sodium and
              water retention, vasoconstriction, increased central venous
              pressure (CVP), which is associated with renal venous
              hypertension/congestion along with increased intra-abdominal
              pressure (IAP). The latter was shown to reduce renal blood flow
              (RBF), leading to a decline in the glomerular filtration rate
              (GFR). Besides the activation of the above-mentioned
              vasoconstrictor/anti-natriuretic neurohormonal systems, HF is
              associated with exceptionally elevated levels of atrial
              natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).
              However, the supremacy of the deleterious neurohormonal systems
              over the beneficial natriuretic peptides (NP) in HF is evident by
              persistent sodium and water retention and cardiac remodeling.
              Many mechanisms have been suggested to explain this phenomenon
              which seems to be multifactorial and play a major role in the
              development of renal hyporesponsiveness to NPs and cardiac
              remodeling. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying the
              development of edema in HF with reduced ejection fraction and
              refers to the therapeutic maneuvers applied today to overcome
              abnormal salt/water balance characterizing HF.",
